- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jaimevaqueiro
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development. I love building web platforms, the process of turning an idea into a portal people can use. I mostly develop with python, using Django.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter... it's so easy and fun! I've built my first two apps (for work) and I'm currently working on a personal project.
